# Youtube Like Shortcut

### Installation

If you want to use this extension, unfortunately you're gonna need to install it manually, because there's an one time $5 fee to deploy the extensions on Chrome Web Store and I just don't want to pay for it now :(

To use this extension, follow these steps:
1. Clone this project
2. Access chrome://extensions and enable **Developer Mode** clicking the button on the upper right corner
4. After enabling developer mode, click on **Load unpacked** and select this projetc's root folder
5. Test your new shortcut by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfR9iY5y94s) :)

### Usage

In any youtube video, just press the key **Q** to like a video. There's no dislike shortcut because we only spread love :)

#### Why the Q key?

Because it's easy to press when only your left hand is over the keyboard.
